REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:
-autoconf
-perl
-perl modules:
	=DBI

DATABASE DEPENDENCIES:
For SQLite:
	-sqlite3 (Any recent version that is not 3.5.9 should work see below for more info.)
	-perl modules
		=DBD-SQLite

For MySQL:
	-mysql v5.0+ (It might work with older versions of mysql, but I haven't tried it)
	-perl modules:
		=DBD-mysql
	
OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:	
-perl modules:
	=Statistics-Descriptive (This is optional, but highly recommended for
		better simulation analysis.)
	=CGI (I think most distros have this installed by default)
-gtk

How to install dependencies:
+Ubuntu/Debian: apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libdbd-sqlite3-perl libdbd-mysql-perl mysql-server libmysqlclient15-dev libstatistics-descriptive-perl libgsl0-dev autoconf
	
	sqlite-3.5.9 has a bug with some of the math functions that prevent Free
	Baseball Simulator from simulating more than 1 season at a time.  If you
	are using Ubuntu/Debian and your version of sqlite is >= 3.5.9 and 
	< 3.5.9-5 you need to download libsqlite3-0_3.5.9-5_i386.deb from here: 
	http://packages.debian.org/lenny/i386/libsqlite3-0/download and
	libsqlite3-dev_3.5.9-5_i386.deb from here:
	http://packages.debian.org/lenny/i386/libsqlite3-dev/download
	then install it with:
	dpkg -i libsqlite3-0_3.5.9-5_i386.deb libsqlite3-dev_3.5.9-5_i386.deb

===== GUI (experimental) =====

If you want to use the GUI, you will need to build it manually and make sure
you have gtk installed.  The configure script does not check for gtk at the
moment.  To install the GUI, do the following:

fbs@server$ cd src
fbs@server$ ./configure
fbs@server$ make
fbs@server$ cd gtk
fbs@server$ make

This will build the program fbs-gtk and install it in the bin directory.
No database setup is needed to use fbs-gtk.

===== Regular Setup =====

There are currently 2 databases supported by Free Baseball Simulator
sqlite and mysql.  Both databases work well, but it is recommended that
you use sqlite since it is easier to setup.

To install with sqlite do the following:

1. Navigate to src directory and run the configure script and make.
fbs@server$ cd src
fbs@server$ autoconf
fbs@server$ ./configure --enable-db=sqlite
fbs@server$ make

2. Navigate to the bin directory and run the init_sqlite.sh script
fbs@server$ cd ../bin
fbs@server$ bash init_sqlite.sh

Now you should be able to use Free Baseball Simulator.  See README file for
more information about using the simulator.

To install with mysql do the following:

1. Navigate to the source directory and run make
fbs@server$ cd src
fbs@server$ autoconf
fbs@server$ ./configure --enable-db=mysql
fbs@server$ make

2. Navigate to bin directory and create a mysql config file.  You can use
mysql.config.example as an example.
NOTE: The config file you create must be called mysql.config
fbs@server$ cd ../bin 
fbs@server$ cp mysql.config.example mysql.config
fbs@server$ vim mysql.config

3. Run the init_mysql.sh script.
fbs@server$ bash init_mysql.sh

Now you should be able to use Free Baseball Simulator.  See README file for
more information.  

==========================================================================

If you have problems, you can try and setup the mysql database manually like this:

1. Navigate to the source directory and run make
fbs@server$ cd src
fbs@server$ make mysql=1

2. Connect to your mysql server and create two new databases.  One will be for
the simulator and one will be to store the benchmark stats.  I usually call them
baseball and real_baseball.
fbs@server$ mysql -u user -p
mysql> create database simulator_dbname;
mysql> create database benchmark_dbname;

3. Run the mysql scripts to create the database tables.
For the simulator database (I call this one baseball) run these scripts in this
order. 
mysql> use baseball;
mysql> \. /path/to/fbs/data/mysql/schema.mysql
mysql> \. /path/to/fbs/data/mysql/names.mysql
mysql> \. /path/to/fbs/data/mysql/test_league.mysql

For the benchmark database (I call this one real_baseball) run this script.

mysql> use real_baseball;
mysql> \. /path/to/fbs/data/mysql/real_baseball.mysql

4. Navigate to bin directory and create a mysql config file.  You can use
mysql.config.example as an example.
NOTE: The config file you create must be called mysql.config
fbs@server$ cd ../bin 
fbs@server$ cp mysql.config.example mysql.config
fbs@server$ vim mysql.config

5. Stay in the bin directory and run the generate_schedule program.
fbs@server$ ./generate_schedule

Now you should be able to use Free Baseball Simulator.  See README file for
more information.
